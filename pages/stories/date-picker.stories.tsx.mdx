## Syntax
```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { DatePicker } from '../libs/date-picker/src';

export default {
  title: 'date-picker',
  component: DatePicker,
};
function setDateResult(date) {
  console.log('Dasboard', date);
}
const selectedDate = new Date(Date.now());
export const Page = (args) => {
  return (
    <DatePicker setDateResult={setDateResult} selectedDate={selectedDate} />
  );
};
```

### Props

 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  ```setDateResult``` (function): A callback function that is called when a date is selected. It receives the selected date as a parameter.

```selectedDate``` (Date): The initially selected date in the Date Picker.
</Callout>


### Code Description:

#### Import Statements:

The code begins by importing the necessary dependencies. It uses React to create a component, and it imports the ```DatePicker``` component from a module located at ```../libs/date-picker/src```
#### Storybook Configuration:

The code sets up a configuration for Storybook. Storybook is a development environment for UI components, allowing developers to visualize and interact with isolated components. In this configuration:
The ```title``` is set to ```date-picker'=```, indicating that this Storybook story will focus on the ```Date Picker``` component.
The ```DatePicker``` component is associated with this story.
#### Function ```setDateResult```:

The ```setDateResult``` function is defined, which appears to be a callback function. It logs the selected ```date``` to the console with the message ```Dashboard```
Initialization of ```selectedDate```:

An ```initial date```, ```selectedDate```, is created using the ```Date``` constructor, set to the current date and time.A React functional component  is defined. the ```DatePicker``` component is rendered.
#### It receives two props:
```setDateResult```: The setDateResult callback function.
```selectedDate```: The selectedDate variable, which sets the initial date for the Date Picker.
## Usage
```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DatePicker } from '../libs/date-picker/src';

function MyDatePickerApp() {
  // Define a state variable to store the selected date
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(new Date());

  // Callback function to handle date selection
  const handleDateSelection = (date) => {
    // Update the selected date in the state
    setSelectedDate(date);
    // You can perform other actions with the selected date here
    console.log('Selected Date:', date);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Date Picker Example</h1>
      {/* Render the DatePicker component */}
      <DatePicker
        selectedDate={selectedDate}
        onSelect={handleDateSelection}
      />
      <p>Selected Date: {selectedDate.toDateString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyDatePickerApp;
```
In this example:

We import the ```DatePicker``` component from ```../libs/date-picker/src```

Inside the ```MyDatePickerApp``` component:

We use the ```useState``` hook to create a state variable called ```selectedDate``` to keep track of the selected date. It is initialized with the current date using the ```new Date()``` constructor.

We define the ```handleDateSelection``` function as a callback to handle date selection. When a date is selected, this function is called, and it updates the ```selectedDate``` state variable with the chosen date.

The ```<DatePicker />``` component is rendered, and it receives the ```selectedDate``` state variable as well as the ```handleDateSelection``` function as props.

We also display the selected date beneath the ```DatePicker``` to show the currently selected date in the UI.
