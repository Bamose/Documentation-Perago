## Getting Started

This generator is built using plop.js, a library used to generate code(config files, components). You see, most of the codes we write here at Perago have similarity and there is a common pattern among the different apps, features and components. And a code one has to write to build a component, let's say a component with CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) features, most probably has already been built before and trying to hard-code this component from scratch is very time-consuming and also violates the basic software engineering principle-DRY(Don't repeat yourself). We also run into the issue of having many kinds of code structures with no one standard. Not to mention components with crud feature take up almost 85% of the codespace we currently have. <br/>

With this generator we aim to solve this issue by converting an already accepted and clean code into a template and generating code by simply changing some variables or names within that template code. The generator accepts input(name, variables, or port number if applicable) from the user from the command line. The detailed instruction on how to use this is explained below.
<br/>

### Prerequisites

To use the generator we need to make sure plop is installed and working.

  ``` bash
  npm install --save-dev plop
  ```

# Usage

We currently have generators for epic and feature(either a basic feature or feature-crud).

## Epic Generator
To generate an epic(Example: apps/back-office/registration) we can enter the below commands from some command line. This commands, though, should be called from the root folder.

1. Generate the epic from the nx generator. This will generate the basic files an epic or app should have to be added to the nx projects workspace and be run from the nx console.

2. Use the epic generator from the command line to adjust the additional configurations needed to successfully create an epic. Use command
   ``` bash
   npm run generate epic
   ```

3. To generate the epic we need 3 inputs: Location(destination folder) of the epic, name of the epic, port number( this is the port number used to locally run it while in development from nx). Running this will successfully generate a basic app shell by adding all the configuration files, folders like pages, store, environment variables, styling configurations.

4. We have successfully generated an app and if we run the app from nx console we will be able to get an app with all the basic epic characteristics we see in other apps, running at the port we provided above.

## Feature Generator

1. Use the feature generator from the command line. Use command
```
   npm run generate feature
   ```

3. After entering the above mentioned inputs, we can successfully generate a full feature code with the entity-list and forms included.
